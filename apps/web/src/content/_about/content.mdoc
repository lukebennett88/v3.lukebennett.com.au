# About

Hi, I’m Luke.

I’m your cliche hipster web-developer — I love coffee and craft beer. I also own a Helvetica poster and have a sticker of a Mac Classic on my car.

I am a father to 7 kids (including 4 awesome step-kids.) I’ve always had a passion for design and I love technology and the open web.

I currently work at&nbsp;[Thinkmill](https://www.thinkmill.com.au/)&nbsp;one of Australia’s leading design & development consultancies.

This website is built with the following stack:

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) a utility-first CSS framework that makes it fast and easy to build UIs.
- [Keystatic](https://keystatic.thinkmill.com.au/) content management for your codebase.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)&nbsp;a powerful React meta framework.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)&nbsp;serverless chosting by the company behind&nbsp;[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
