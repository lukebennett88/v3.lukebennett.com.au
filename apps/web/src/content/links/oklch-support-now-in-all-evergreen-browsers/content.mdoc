I was looking through the [release notes for Firefox 113](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/113.0/releasenotes/) and saw that they've added support for OKLCH.

Firefox is the last of the "evergreen" browsers to support this new colour space.

If you're wondering why this is cool, check out [this article by Evil Martians](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/oklch-in-css-why-quit-rgb-hsl).
