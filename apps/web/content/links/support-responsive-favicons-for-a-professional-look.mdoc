TIL you can use a&nbsp;`media`&nbsp;attribute on a&nbsp;`<link>`&nbsp;element to offer both light and dark mode versions of your favicon.

The cool thing about this approach is that it doesn't appear to require a manual page refresh when you change modes for the favicon to switch. That's not the case with&nbsp;[this approach](https://css-tricks.com/dark-mode-favicons/)&nbsp;which I've used in the past.
