Looks like the Polaris team have been busy! Very cool to see my former colleagues [Charles Lee](https://github.com/gwyneplaine), [Dominik Wilkowski](https://github.com/dominikwilkowski) and [Jess Telford](https://github.com/jesstelford) listed in the credits.

Super weird that this was a "members only" article on Medium though, Shopify should put this on a blog they own.
