I personally like [Seaford](https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/07/office-fonts/Seaford%20Specimen.pdf) the most, which doesn't surprise me as it was co-designed by [Tobias Frere-Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobias_Frere-Jones) who has designed some of my favourite typefaces such as Whitney and the slightly overused Gotham.
