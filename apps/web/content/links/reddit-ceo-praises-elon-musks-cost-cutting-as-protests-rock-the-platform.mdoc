Imagine being the CEO of Reddit, looking at what's happened to Twitter over the last few months and thinking "I like what this Elon guy is doing, we should do something similar"&nbsp;ðŸ™ƒ

Huffman also did an interview with [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/15/23762868/reddit-ceo-steve-huffman-interview). Gruber wrote about the Verge interview [on Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/16/peters-huffman-interview) and absolutely nails it with this line:

> No surprise that the CEO of a company whose website is so bad that theyâ€™ve had to keep&nbsp;[the old one](https://old.reddit.com/)&nbsp;around as an alternative doesnâ€™t see the value Apollo adds to the Reddit experience.
