Here is a list of the tools I use for work, inspired by [this post from Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/uses).

## Computer / Office

- MacBook Air (M1, 2020)
- Desk: [Updown Desk 180cm Bamboo standing desk](https://updowndesk.com.au/products/updown-desk-pro-series-electric-standing-desk-with-bamboo-desktop?variant=37579954847913)

- Mouse: Logitech MX Master 3

## Coding

- Theme: Night Owl
- Font: [IBM Plex Mono](https://www.ibm.com/plex/)
- Terminal(s): Integrated terminal in VS Code with [Fig](https://fig.io/), [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/)

## CLIs

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- [dog](https://dns.lookup.dog/) (a better [dig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dig_\(command\)))
- [volta](https://volta.sh/) (a better [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
- [gh](https://cli.github.com/) (for working with GitHub)
- [node/npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) (duh)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (npm alternative that Thinkmill sponsors)

## Browser(s)

[Brave](https://brave.com/) is pretty decent, it's basically Google Chrome without all the gross Google stuff. This is my primary browser.

Safari is better than people give it credit for, but I have to admit the dev tools aren't as good, and there are still plenty of websites that don't work as well in it (or at at all in some cases, but I don't think this is necessarily Safari's fault). I use Safari to keep work and personal stuff seperate as well as access tabs that I have open on my phone.

I keep trying to use [Arc](https://arc.net/) because it's very well designed, but I'm not sure it's for me. I'm still experimenting though.
