Back in April, [I gave a talk at Syd JS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5uS5DIKQbU) about lessons learned while using Tailwind to build a design system. While I’ve been a Tailwind fan for years (since version `0.5.2`!), this was my first time applying it to a design system since joining Thinkmill. The process challenged me to rethink a few things.

Fun fact: I’m pretty sure the first time I heard about Thinkmill was through Tailwind super-fan (and now friend) [Simon Swiss](https://simonswiss.com/). Without Tailwind, I don’t think I’d be working at Thinkmill today!

The talk itself was just 25 minutes — too short to dive into the deeper, more in-the-weeds details that I hadn’t seen covered elsewhere. To fill in those gaps, I wrote a companion piece which [you can find on the Thinkmill blog](https://www.thinkmill.com.au/blog/building-a-multi-brand-design-system-with-tailwind-tips-tricks-and-tradeoffs). It’s a hefty read, clocking in at over 3,200 words, so grab a coffee (or your beverage of choice) and get comfy cause it might be a while!

If you find the talk or the article useful, I’d love to hear your thoughts!

And if your team needs help with a design system, [I can’t recommend Thinkmill enough](https://www.thinkmill.com.au/contact).
